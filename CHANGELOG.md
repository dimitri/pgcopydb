### pgcopydb v0.16 (May 22, 2024) ###

### pgcopydb v0.12 (June 28, 2023) ###

This is a bugfix release with a strong focus on our logical decoding client.
The support for test_decoding UPDATE messages is improved, and a lot of bugs
related to how we split JSON messages in separate files (same as Postgres
WAL naming) have now been found and fixed.

An important fix has been implemented with respect to how Postgres snapshots
and logical decoding works. The replication command CREATE_REPLICATION_SLOT
is able to export a snapshot but can not import one, which means that
`pgcopydb snapshot` now has a new `--follow` command which creates a
replication slot and exports a snapshot to re-use in the rest of the
commands.

### pgcopydb v0.11 (March 15, 2023) ###

plugin test_decoding in addition to wal2json, and also introduces the fully
automated switch from prefetch and catchup replication to live streaming.

More features are added such as support for skipping collations, support for
skipping role passwords, a feature to cache the `pg_table_size()` results
and avoid re-computing it again when doing more than one migration with
pgcopydb, and the new `pgcopydb ping` command.

code refactoring, etc.

### pgcopydb v0.9 (September 30, 2022) ###

Improve pgcopydb with same-table concurrency support, lots of bug fixes
including the new support for Extension Configuration Tables and the
automated sequences reset after a --follow cutover. New options to control
verbosity have also been added: --debug and --trace are added to --verbose.

The pgcopydb internal sub-process model has been entirely reviewed. In
version 0.9 a System V queue mechanism is used to communicate jobs from a
main process to a list of worker processes. This has been applied to CREATE
INDEX and VACUUM jobs, in a way that with --index-jobs 4 pgcopydb now starts
4 create index worker processes at start-up; where it would before create
worker processes each time a table copy would be finished.

As a result the --index-jobs limit is now enforced correctly.

### Added
* Implement same-table concurrency. (#85)
* Add support for Extension Configuration Tables (#101)
* Reset sequences at the end of pgcopydb clone --follow. (#76)

* A round of documentation updates. (#98)
* Improve documentation of the --follow option. (#81)

### Fixed
* Bug fixes for the transform process. (#114)
* Use docker-compose run in tests, instead of docker-compose up. (#113)
* From the lab: we could have more lines in a WAL.json file. (#112)
* Fix docs for pgcopydb dump schema --target etc. (#109)
* Add more pg restore object descriptions, from shared logs. (#107)

### pgcopydb v0.8 (July 20, 2022) ###

Implement support for Change Data Capture, the ability to replay changes
happening on the source database during and after the base copy. This is
available thanks to the new `--follow` option and allows keeping the target
database up-to-date. The Change Data Capture for Postgres is implemented
using the Logical Decoding framework and the wal2json logical decoding
plugin.

In the course of adding that capability to pgcopydb, the command line
interface have been updated. The main command is now `pgcopydb clone` and
the command `pgcopydb fork` is an alias for it. The command `pgcopydb
copy-db` has been kept around for backwards compatibility, and will be
removed in a later release.

### Added
* Run our tests suites in the GitHub Action CI.
* Implement `pgcopydb snapshot`. (#63)
* Implement support for copying roles. (#64)
* Implement pgcopydb stream prefetch. (#65)
* Implement pgcopydb stream catchup. (#66)
* Implement pgcopydb follow. (#68)
* Implement pgcopydb clone --follow. (#72)

### Changed
* Set `tcp_keepalives_idle` to 60s on the source database.
* Review the pgcopydb commands. (#62)

### Fixed
* Fix logging of total reltuples. (#47)
* Fix pgcopydb list tables --without-pkeys SQL queries. (#55)
* Make sure to use pg_restore --single-transaction.
* Fix NULL columns processing when listing schema dependencies. (#71)

### pgcopydb v0.7 (May 24, 2022) ###

--pre-data parts of the schema.

### Added
* Use 'pgcopydb' as our application_name in Postgres connections. (#42)
* Implement pgcopydb copy schema. (#46)

### Changed
* Skip long-running transactions when --not-consistent is used. (#45)

### Fixed
* Fix filtering of the pre-data section of the dump. (#44)

### pgcopydb v0.6 (May 16, 2022) ###

### pgcopydb v0.5 (March 11, 2022) ###

Quick turnaround release with Postgres connection management bug fixes. The
bug was caught by our debian test suite which defaults to using SSL, and
using SSL makes the problem systematic rather than unlucky.
