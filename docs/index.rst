   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to pgcopydb's documentation!
====================================

The `pgcopydb`__ project is an Open Source Software project. The development
happens at `https://github.com/dimitri/pgcopydb`__ and is public: everyone
is welcome to participate by opening issues, pull requests, giving feedback,
etc.

Remember that the first steps are to actually play with the ``pgcopydb``
command, then read the entire available documentation (after all, I took the
time to write it), and then to address the community in a kind and polite
way â€” the same way you would expect people to use when addressing you.
