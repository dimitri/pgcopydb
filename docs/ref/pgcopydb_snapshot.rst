pgcopydb snapshot - Create and export a snapshot on the source database

The command ``pgcopydb snapshot`` connects to the source database and
executes a SQL query to export a snapshot. The obtained snapshot is both
printed on stdout and also in a file where other pgcopydb commands might
expect to find it.

::

   pgcopydb snapshot: Create and export a snapshot on the source database
   usage: pgcopydb snapshot  --source ...

     --source         Postgres URI to the source database
     --dir            Work directory to use
     --follow         Implement logical decoding to replay changes
     --plugin         Output plugin to use (test_decoding, wal2json)
     --slot-name      Use this Postgres replication slot name

Options
-------

The following options are available to ``pgcopydb create`` and ``pgcopydb
drop`` subcommands:

--source

  Connection string to the source Postgres instance. See the Postgres
  documentation for `connection strings`__ for the details. In short both
  the quoted form ``"host=... dbname=..."`` and the URI form
  ``postgres://user@host:5432/dbname`` are supported.

  __ https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING

--dir

  During its normal operations pgcopydb creates a lot of temporary files to
  track sub-processes progress. Temporary files are created in the directory
  location given by this option, or defaults to
  ``${TMPDIR}/pgcopydb`` when the environment variable is set, or
  then to ``/tmp/pgcopydb``.

--follow

  When the ``--follow`` option is used then pgcopydb implements Change Data
  Capture as detailed in the manual page for :ref:`pgcopydb_follow` in
  parallel to the main copy database steps.

  The replication slot is created using the Postgres replication protocol
  command CREATE_REPLICATION_SLOT, which then exports the snapshot being
  used in that command.

--plugin

  Logical decoding output plugin to use. The default is `test_decoding`__
  which ships with Postgres core itself, so is probably already available on
  your source server.

  It is possible to use `wal2json`__ instead. The support for wal2json is
  mostly historical in pgcopydb, it should not make a user visible
  difference whether you use the default test_decoding or wal2json.

  __ https://github.com/eulerto/wal2json/

--slot-name

  Logical decoding slot name to use.

--verbose

  Increase current verbosity. The default level of verbosity is INFO. In
  ascending order pgcopydb knows about the following verbosity levels:
  FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, NOTICE, DEBUG, TRACE.

--debug

  Set current verbosity to DEBUG level.

--trace

  Set current verbosity to TRACE level.

--quiet

  Set current verbosity to ERROR level.

Environment
-----------

PGCOPYDB_SOURCE_PGURI

  Connection string to the source Postgres instance. When ``--source`` is
  ommitted from the command line, then this environment variable is used.

Examples
--------

Create a snapshot on the source database in the background:

::

   $ pgcopydb snapshot &
   [1] 72938
   17:31:52 72938 INFO  Running pgcopydb version 0.7.13.gcbf2d16.dirty from "/Users/dim/dev/PostgreSQL/pgcopydb/./src/bin/pgcopydb/pgcopydb"
   17:31:52 72938 INFO  Using work dir "/var/folders/d7/zzxmgs9s16gdxxcm0hs0sssw0000gn/T//pgcopydb"
   17:31:52 72938 INFO  Removing the stale pid file "/var/folders/d7/zzxmgs9s16gdxxcm0hs0sssw0000gn/T//pgcopydb/pgcopydb.aux.pid"

   00000003-000CB5FE-1

And when the process is done, stop maintaining the snapshot in the
background:

::

   $ kill %1
   17:31:56 72938 INFO  Asked to terminate, aborting
   [1]+  Done                    pgcopydb snapshot
